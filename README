
Multiespecific neutral/hierachical stochastic model

This models are neutral because all species have the same parameters
except the probability of colonization from metacommunity 
this probability can be made uniform and very low to simulate speciation

There are actually 4 models built in
1. Non-saturated neutral (Etienne 2007)
2. Saturated Neutral 
3. Non-saturated Hierarchical (Tilman 1994)
4. Saturated Hierarchical
