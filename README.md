
Multiespecific neutral/hierachical stochastic model
===================================================

This is C++ code for neutral/hierarchical competition models. In these all species have the same parameters except the probability of colonization from metacommunity. 

There are actually 4 models built in
1. Non-saturated neutral (Etienne 2007)
2. Saturated Neutral 
3. Non-saturated Hierarchical (Tilman 1994)
4. Saturated Hierarchical
