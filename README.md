
Multiespecific neutral/hierachical stochastic spatial model
===========================================================

This a stochastic CA or also called interactive particle system for neutral/hierarchical models. 
In the neutral models all species have the same parameters except the probability of colonization from metacommunity that is proportional to the frequency on the metacommunity. This probability can be made uniform and very low to simulate speciation.

There are actually 4 models built in

1. Non-saturated neutral (Etienne 2007)
2. Saturated Neutral 
3. Non-saturated Hierarchical (Tilman 1994)
4. Saturated Hierarchical 

Three kinds of dispersal

1. Uniform
2. Exponential
3. Inverse power
