This is C++ code for neutral/hierarchical competition models. In these all species have the same parameters except the probability of colonization from metacommunity. More details are given in the file ModelDescription.md

There are actually 5 similar models built in

1. Non-saturated neutral (Etienne 2007)
2. Saturated Neutral 
3. Non-saturated Hierarchical (Tilman 1994)
4. Saturated Hierarchical 
5. Continuum model between 2 and 4 (or 1 and 3)

And three dispersal kernels

1. Uniform
2. Exponential
3. Inverse power 

It was compiled using Gnu C++ (g++ v5.3.0) to compile it. For a crude and slow graphical output you will need the X11 SDL development libraries and the GRX graphics library http://grx.gnu.de/grx246um.htm

You also need the code from: 
	
1. <https://github.com/lsaravia/mfsba> if you want the multifractal spectra output otherwise you have to comment the calls to the function *MultifractalSBA* and the includes to *mf.h* header.
2. <https://github.com/lsaravia/Clusters> to calculate cluster statistics. 

To compile under Windows there is a separate makefileWin.mak, you might have to modify the folders of the *mfsba* and *Clusters* sources.
